# Percentage of Accounts Receivable Beyond X Days

PARBX resolves the sensitivity issues of the [1. Introduction](1-introduction.md) metric. It offers a simple billing process metric that’s not dependent on the charge. 

Its graphic representation has a skewed bell shape. Its steepness represents billing process quality; a steep curve and thin tail mean a healthy billing process, while a flat bell and fat tail also mean billing problems. 

According to the MGMA survey, 25%-35% of the average family practice’s accounts receivables were more than 120 days old in 1997. This number has improved down to 17.7% in 2004.
