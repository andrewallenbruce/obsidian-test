# MACRA Introduction
##### Guidance for APM and MIPS Proficiency

The **Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA)** was a monumental move toward healthcare reform. It set the wheels in motion for a new healthcare ideology, incentivizing clinicians to provide quality, cost-efficient care by sharing in the spoils collected from those who don’t. The implications of MACRA are massive and not easily understood. Like all problems that require complex strategies, MACRA presents known rules (and exceptions) while simultaneously raising unprecedented questions.

# MACRA ^[CFR 42 Part 414, Subpart O; www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/42/part-414/subpart-O]:
1. Repealed the sustainable growth rate (SGR) formula used to update the [Medicare Physician Fee Schedule](medicare-physician-fee-schedule.md) (MPFS)

2. Reauthorized the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP); and
 
3. Changed the way Medicare incorporates quality measurement into payments.

Together, these policies are referred to as the Quality Payment Program (QPP). The SGR^[Sustainable Growth Rates & Conversion Factors; www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/SustainableGRatesConFact/index.html?redirect=/SustainableGRatesConFact/] was enacted under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to control Medicare spending. The flaw in the system was that physicians’ payment rates under the rule dropped so low that the SGR had to be suspended or adjusted by Congress every year to prevent physicians from opting out of Medicare. MACRA provided automatic, annual update to the single conversion factor of 0.5 percent for all physicians and other qualified healthcare professionals through 2019. 

Medicare Part B payment rates will stay frozen at 2019 levels through 2025. Beginning in 2019, eligible clinicians (defined later) will either receive negative, neutral, or positive [Adjustments](adjustments.md) to their Medicare Part B payments based on their performance in the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) or a MIPS Alternative Payment Model (APM), or earn a lump sum bonus for participation in an Advanced Alternative Payment Model (APM).

Under MACRA, Medicare’s costly and complex quality initiatives — the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS), the Value‐Based Modifier Program (VM), and the Medicare Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program, also known as Meaningful Use — ended on Dec. 31, 2018. Components of the PQRS, VM, and Meaningful Use programs live on in MIPS, however.

The overarching goal of the QPP is to implement a patient-centered healthcare system that delivers **better care**, **smarter spending**, and **healthier people**. In theory, increasing the health of our population will reduce medical costs and preserve Medicare’s main trust fund, which is on track to run dry by 2026^[Office of the Chief Actuary, 2018 Trustees Report, Actuarial Publications].
