# Write-Off
*Administrative write-offs are any write-off that is not a contractual adjustment or determination by a payer.*

[Adjustments](adjustments.md) to billed charges are often undermanaged. Contractual adjustments made to accounts are standard when you contract with insurance companies and bill [Medicare](medicare.md) and [Medicaid](medicaid.md). Contractual adjustments should be set up to include the insurance company’s name. Administrative write-offs are any write-off that is not a contractual adjustment or determination by a payer.

Monitoring write-offs can protect against employee dishonesty or incompetence. [Adjustments](adjustments.md) tend to mirror receipts, not charges. In a month with above average receipts, expect above average [Adjustments](adjustments.md). If [Adjustments](adjustments.md) appear too low, too high, or don’t mirror cash receipts, look for unusual levels of [Medicare](medicare.md) or [Medicaid](medicaid.md) postings, staff not writing off bad debt on a regular basis, claim filing errors, inappropriate write-offs, or other posting errors.

An effective revenue cycle policy would allow for several different adjustment codes to accurately track [Adjustments](adjustments.md). The decision of how many adjustment codes, and the description of those codes, is up to each practice. Taking time to define and manage adjustment options are critical to creating efficiency in managing the adjustment and write-off process more effectively.
