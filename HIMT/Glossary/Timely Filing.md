# Timely Filing
*Timely filing is the deadline for submitting a [Clean claim](clean-claim.md) to an insurance payer.*

Each payer has its own timely filing limits, which should be clearly stated in the contract. When a claim is denied for timely filing, the biller can use the electronic acceptance reports from the payer to prove the claim was filed within the timely filing limit originally.

In cases when the timely filing deadline was missed, obtaining payment for these types of [claims](claim-form.md) can be challenging. There may be a valid reason that timely filing was not met. For example, a patient received services and wasn’t aware that he or she had coverage at the time of the service. Later, it is determined that the patient did have coverage. In this case, an appeal should be made. Draft an appeal letter explaining the circumstances responsible for missing the deadline. Whenever there is a valid explanation, it’s worth appealing.

Best practice is to avoid missing timely filing deadlines altogether. Be aware of each payer’s timely filing criteria and develop a systematic approach to consistently meet or beat the deadlines.
