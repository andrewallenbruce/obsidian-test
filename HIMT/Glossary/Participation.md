# Participation
*When it comes to health plans, commercial or government, providers choose whether to participate.*

## PAR
A participating (PAR) provider signs a contract with a health plan to agree to accept assignment for all covered services furnished to its members and to submit [claims](claim-form.md) for the services they provide. In some cases, the member is responsible for deductibles and coinsurance amounts. A participating provider must [write-off](write-off.md) any amounts billed on covered services that are above the negotiated rate. 
## Non-PAR
Non-participating providers (non-PAR) choose to not accept assignment. A non-participating provider may bill the patient for the difference between the amount billed and the amount paid by the health plan (except for [Medicare](medicare.md)). The advantage of participating is that the health plan agrees to direct covered members to the provider. The health plan also agrees to pay the provider directly for the services provided, sometimes in an expedited manner in relation to nonparticipating providers. In the case of [Medicare](medicare.md) participating providers, the [Fee schedule](fee-schedule.md) amount is five percent higher than that of non-participating providers. If a provider decides not to participate, the patient usually receives the payment and the office must collect all money due from them. In the case of [Medicare](medicare.md), a limiting charge applies to non-participating providers, which is 115 percent of the physician [Fee schedule](fee-schedule.md) amount. Some states have more stringent guidelines on limiting charges. For example, in New York the limiting charge is set at 105 percent instead of 115. The provider is still required to submit a claim to [Medicare](medicare.md) for services rendered.

## Opt-Out
For [Medicare](medicare.md), there is a third option regarding participation. Providers may opt-out of the [Medicare](medicare.md) program. These providers are not limited to any specific charge limit on their patients. They do not submit claims to [Medicare](medicare.md) for their services and have their patients sign private contracts regarding payment for services rendered. The patient is responsible for payment in full for services as [Medicare](medicare.md) will not pay any amount to either the patient or provider in this situation. Providers have an open enrollment period just like patients. Toward the end of each calendar year, usually from mid-November through December 31, all [MAC](medicare-administrative-contractor-mac.md)/carriers hold open enrollment. This is the only time providers can change their participation status with [Medicare](medicare.md). New providers can sign the participation agreement at the time of their enrollment into the [Medicare](medicare.md) program and will become effective on the date of filing.

## State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP)
The State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) is a program that offers free health benefits counseling to [Medicare](medicare.md) beneficiaries, their families, or caregivers. Each state has a SHIP and it can be located at the following website: [Find your State’s State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP)](https://www.seniorsresourceguide.com/directories/National/SHIP) .

They can educate patients on participating/non-participating/ opt-out providers and what it means for them. They also hold free workshops and will have calendar listings on their websites for [Medicare](medicare.md) Monday events. This is a good resource to direct patients to for additional assistance.
