# Medically Unlikely Edits (MUE)
*Part of [ NCCI](national-correct-coding-initiative.md) edits that places limits on the frequency that individual codes can be billed on a single date of service by a single provider for a single [Beneficiary](beneficiary.md).*

To help reduce the paid claims error rate for [Medicare](medicare.md) Part B claims, [CMS](cms.md) developed Medically Unlikely Edits (MUEs). MUEs define the maximum units of service that a provider would report, under most circumstances, for a single [Beneficiary](beneficiary.md), on a single date of service, for a specific [HCPCS](hcpcs-level-ii.md)/[CPT](current-procedural-terminology.md)® code. If a code is denied for MUE, the [Advanced Beneficiary Notice](advanced-beneficiary-notice.md) is not applicable, and the patient cannot be billed.

## The MUE Table
Below is a portion of the MUE table:

1. HCPCS/CPT® Code: This indicates the HCPCS Level II code or CPT® code.
2. Practitioner Services MUE Values: This indicates the number of units that may be billed for the HCPCS Level II code or CPT code.
3. MUE [Adjudication](adjudication.md) Indicator (MAI): This indicates the type of MUE and its basis. An MAI of 2 indicates an [Edit](edit.md) for which the MUE is based on regulation or sub-regulatory instructions (policy), including the instruction that is inherent in the code descriptor or its applicable anatomy. An MAI of 3 indicates an [Edit](edit.md) for which the MUE is based on clinical information, such as billing patterns, prescribing instructions, or other information. MAI 3 is the most common per day [Edit](edit.md).
4. MUE Rationale: This specifies the [Adjudication](adjudication.md) indicator as to whether it is due to anatomic consideration, nature of service, code descriptor or CPT® instruction, clinical data, or [CMS](cms.md) policy.
