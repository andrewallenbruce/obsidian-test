# Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC)
*A company under contract with the federal government to handle claims processing for [Medicare](medicare.md) services.*

MACs are entities (third party payers, insurance companies) that contract with the federal government to adjudicate and process claims in the geographical region for which they have been given jurisdiction. The MAC is responsible for making coverage decision policies and protecting the integrity of the [Medicare](medicare.md) program. Each MAC and the jurisdiction they are responsible for may have differing policies.

title: Billing
It is critical for billers to know what jurisdiction they are in and the policies of the MAC responsible for processing claims in that jurisdiction. The contracts can be reassigned periodically to a different MAC, which can cause the policies to change.
