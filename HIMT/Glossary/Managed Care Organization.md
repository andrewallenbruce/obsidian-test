# Managed Care Organization (MCO)
*An organization that combines the functions of health insurance, delivery of care, and administration.*

## MCO Types
MCO is an umbrella term for organizations that are affiliated with or own hospitals, physician groups, and other providers which provide a wide range of coordinated health services. MCOs manage benefits and develop participating provider networks. These include:

- [Exclusive Provider Organization](exclusive-provider-organization.md) (EPOs)
- [Health Maintenance Organization](health-maintenance-organization.md) (HMOs)
- [Integrated Delivery Systems](integrated-delivery-systems.md) (IDSs)
- [Preferred Provider Organization](preferred-provider-organization.md) (PPOs)
- [Triple Option Plans](triple-option-plans.md)

## MCO Features
Managed care organizations offer managed care provisions that provide insurers with ways to manage the cost, use, and quality of healthcare services received by group members, including:
### Utilization review
The process of reviewing the appropriateness and quality of care provided to patients. It may take place before, during, or after the services are rendered.
### Preadmission certification
Authorization for hospital admissions given by a healthcare provider to a group member prior to hospitalization. Failure to obtain preadmission certification in non-emergency situations reduces, and in some cases eliminates, the healthcare provider’s obligation to pay for services rendered.
### Preadmission testing
A requirement designed to encourage patients to obtain necessary diagnostic services on an outpatient basis prior to non-emergency hospital admission. This is performed to reduce the length of the hospital stay.
### Non-emergency weekend admission restriction
A requirement that imposes limits on reimbursement to patients for non-emergency weekend hospital admissions.
### Second surgical opinion
This is a cost-management strategy that either encourages or requires patients to obtain the opinion of another physician after a physician has recommended that a non-emergency or elective surgery be performed. If the second opinion is required, reimbursement may be reduced or denied if the patient does not obtain the second opinion. These opinions are usually required to be received from board-certified specialists with no personal or financial interest in the decision.
