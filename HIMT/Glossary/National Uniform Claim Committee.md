# National Uniform Claim Committee (NUCC)
*The responsibility for development and maintenance of the [CMS-1500](cms-1500.md) [Claim Form](claim-form.md) rests with the National Uniform Claim Committee (NUCC). Originally the CMS-1500 claim form was developed under the direction of the Uniform Claim Form Task Force, which was co-chaired by the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid](cms.md) Services (CMS) and the American Medical Association (AMA). The CMS-1500 [Claim Form](claim-form.md) is considered public domain and is not subject to copyright restrictions. The NUCC consists of diverse stakeholders representing the interests of providers, payers, Designated Standards Maintenance Organizations (DSMO), vendors, and public health organizations.*
