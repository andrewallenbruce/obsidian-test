# Medical necessity
*A decision made by a health plan as to whether a treatment, test, or procedure is necessary for a patient’s health or to treat a diagnosed medical condition.*

Health insurance companies only cover services they define as medically necessary. Medical necessity is defined differently by different entities.

According to § 1862(a)(1)(A) of the [Social Security Act](social-security-act.md), [Medicare](medicare.md) will not cover services that “are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member.”

The [American Medical Association](american-medical-association.md)’s (AMA) Model [Managed Care](managed-care-organization.md) Contract contains a definition of medically necessary services as “Healthcare services or procedures that a prudent physician would provide to a patient for the purpose of preventing, diagnosing or treating an illness, injury, disease or its symptoms in a manner that is 
- (a) in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice; 
- (b) clinically appropriate in terms of type, frequency, extent, site and duration; and 
- (c) not primarily for the economic benefit of the health plans and purchasers or for the convenience of the patient, treating physician or other healthcare provider.”

Basically, medical necessity is a decision made by a health plan as to whether a treatment, test, or procedure is necessary for a patient’s health or to treat a diagnosed medical problem. [Medicare](medicare.md) releases [National Coverage Determination](national-coverage-determination.md)s (NCDs) and the [Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC)](medicare-administrative-contractor-mac.md)s (MACs) release [Local Coverage Determination](local-coverage-determination.md)s (LCDs) to state whether an item or service will be considered medically necessary. The [National Correct Coding Initiative](national-correct-coding-initiative.md) (NCCI) is released by the [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid](cms.md) Services (CMS) to indicate codes considered to be bundled for procedures and services deemed necessary to accomplish a [major](major-surgery.md) procedure. [Medically Unlikely Edits](medically-unlikely-edits.md) (MUEs) are released by [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid](cms.md) to indicate the number of units that can be reported for a service or procedure on the same day.
