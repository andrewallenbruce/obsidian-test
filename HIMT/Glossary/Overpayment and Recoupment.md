# Overpayment and Recoupment
An overpayment occurs when too much has been paid to a provider and a refund to [Medicare](medicare.md) is necessary.

Overpayments are either communicated to a provider via a Noridian Demand Letter **or** self-reported by a provider. To be in compliance with [Medicare](medicare.md) policies for reporting and repaying overpayments, selecting the appropriate payment method for each situation is critical.
