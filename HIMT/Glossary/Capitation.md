# Capitation
*Fixed payment remitted at regular intervals to a medical provider by a [Managed Care Organization](managed-care-organization.md) for an enrolled patient.*

Capitation payments are used by [Managed Care Organization](managed-care-organization.md)s (MCOs) to control healthcare costs by putting the physicians at financial risk for services provided to patients. Payments are based on a per-person rate, rather than a fee-for-service rate. The MCO measures rates of resource utilization in physician practices to ensure its members are receiving appropriate care. These reports are made available to the public for quality measures. They may also be linked to bonuses which are financial incentives to encourage efficiency for physicians to reduce or limit services.

```ad-Example
title: EXAMPLE
Dr. Taylor is a family practice provider in a capitated plan. The provider receives a flat rate per member, per month from the capitated plan. For the year, the provider is paid $100,000 under the capitated plan. At the end of the year he evaluates his cost for care of the patients and determines a cost of $105,000. 

Based on the capitated contract, the provider loses $5,000 on this contract. If the provider determined a cost of $80,000 for the care of the patients, the provider has a profit of $20,000 for this capitated contract.
```

The MCO sets the rate after determining the services that will be provided and the length of time they will be provided, using local costs and average service utilization to set the rate. The amounts may vary from region to region. There are also risk pools that are sometimes created as a percentage of the capitation withheld from the physician until the end of the fiscal year. The physician will receive the money if the health plan does well and is forfeited if the plan does poorly. 

## Capitation Rate Schedule
This table is an example of what a capitation rate schedule may cover. Rates for each member are based on age ranges as the costs for providing care for patients are, overall, different for different age ranges. It also indicates a withhold amount. Some plans may offer different schedules by patient sex, different categories of ages, and different withhold amounts.

| Member’s Age | Capitation PMPM | 10% Withold | Payment PMPM |
| ------------ | --------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 0 - 1        | $25.00          | $2.50       | $22.50       |
| 2 - 4        | $10.00          | $1.00       | $9.00        |
| 5 - 20       | $5.00           | $0.50       | $4.50        |
| 20 - 60      | $15.00          | $1.50       | $13.50       |
| 50 - 65      | $25.00          | $2.50       | $22.50       |

Most capitated plans for primary care services include preventive, diagnostic, and treatment services; injections, immunizations, and medications that are administered in an office; outpatient laboratory testing performed in the office or designated lab; and routine vision and hearing screenings. Along with capitation, though, some additional services are paid on a fee-for-service basis, called “[Carve-out](carve-out.md)” services.

## Advantages of Capitation
The advantage of capitation is that a stronger relationship is built between patient and physician since the patients will receive most of their care from the same physician. It lowers the risk of patients having unnecessary services or being over-treated as the physician is vested in keeping costs down and not ordering medically unnecessary treatments. The cost of treatment is spread out among all members, so the cost of treatment is lower per patient overall. Since the physician will prosper if the patients are better, capitation promotes preventive measures, counseling, and patient education. When a patient does require treatment, the physician will choose the best treatment for the patient as there is no interest in choosing costly treatments for higher reimbursement.

### Benefits of capitation, if care is managed correctly
- Guaranteed income with a check of a specified amount at the same time each month
- Decreased cost of bookkeeping as no statements need to be sent, no [write-offs](write-off.md) taken on accounts, no untimely payments, no bad debt, etc.
- Decreased time for billing staff as no claims (except [Carve-out](carve-out.md) services) are sent and no appeals are necessary so billers may concentrate on other payers
- The physician does not have to wait for reimbursement
- Possible increase in market share as capitated patients may talk to others about the provider

## Disadvantages of Capitation
The disadvantage to capitation is that it involves total assumption of risk on the part of the physician. It is difficult to predict the costs of all healthcare to all patients in advance. It may cause physicians to take on too large a roster of members into its practice to increase its payment.

### Other disadvantages include:
- Patients must receive primary care from only one physician or physician group
- Physicians may have to limit capitated patients seen to control costs
- If one group has a large sick capitated population, they may make little or no profit, or suffer financial loss
- Specialists may be hesitant to enter into capitation as they are at risk for over-utilization by primary care physicians
- Sophisticated software may be necessary for large groups to track utilization, costs, and perform risk calculations
