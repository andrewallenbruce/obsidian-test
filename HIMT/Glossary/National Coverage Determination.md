# National Coverage Determination (NCD)
*Nationwide determination as to whether [Medicare](medicare.md) will pay for an item or service.

The Medicare Coverage Database is a searchable database that contains all Medicare [National Coverage Determination](national-coverage-determination.md)s (NCDs), National Coverage Analyses (NCAs), [Local Coverage Determinations](local-coverage-determination.md) (LCDs), local articles, and other information. NCAs include proposed NCD decisions. The NCD is intended to be used by Medicare Contractors, providers, and other healthcare professionals.

NCDs’ statutory and policy framework are based on § 1862 of Title XVIII of the [Social Security Act](social-security-act.md) and Medicare regulations and rulings. The NCD Manual indicates whether specific medical services, items, treatment procedures, or technologies can be paid for by Medicare. All decisions of denial of coverage are based on §1862(a)(1) of the Act unless otherwise specifically noted. 

Medicare contractors are required to follow NCDs unless an NCD does not specifically exclude or limit an indication or circumstance, or if the item or service is not mentioned at all in either the NCD or a [Medicare](medicare.md) manual. In such circumstances, the Medicare contractor can make an [LCD](local-coverage-determination.md). NCDs and [LCDs](local-coverage-determination.md) are updated as they are published. 

An [LCD](local-coverage-determination.md) is mandated at the [Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC)](medicare-administrative-contractor-mac.md) (MAC) level. The guidelines given are only applicable to that specific [MAC](medicare-administrative-contractor-mac.md)’s jurisdiction. [Medicare](medicare.md) contractors develop the [LCDs](local-coverage-determination.md) when there is no NCD or when there is a need to further define an NCD. Chapter 13 of the [Medicare](medicare.md) Program Integrity Manual contains the guidelines for [LCD](local-coverage-determination.md) development. When there is an NCD and an [LCD](local-coverage-determination.md) for the same procedure, the NCD takes precedence.
