# Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
*Insurance program that provides low-cost health coverage to children in families that earn too much money to qualify for [Medicaid](medicaid.md) but not enough to buy private insurance.* 

In some states, CHIP covers pregnant women. Each state offers CHIP coverage and works closely with its state [Medicaid](medicaid.md) program. You can apply any time. If you qualify, your coverage can begin immediately, any time of year.
