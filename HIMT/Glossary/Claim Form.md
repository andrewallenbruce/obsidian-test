# Claim Form
*Used to report the procedures performed and the reason the procedures were performed to the insurance carrier to obtain payment for those services.*

Claim forms are used to report the procedures performed and the reason the procedures were performed to the insurance carrier to obtain payment for those services. There are two claim forms used; the [CMS-1500](cms-1500.md) claim form and the [UB-04](ub-04.md) claim form. The CMS-1500 claim form is used to report the professional services performed by providers and [Ambulatory Surgical Center](ambulatory-surgical-center.md)s (ASCs). The UB-04 claim form is used to report facility services.

## National Uniform Claim Committee (NUCC)
The responsibility for development and maintenance of the [CMS-1500](cms-1500.md) claim form rests with the [National Uniform Claim Committee](national-uniform-claim-committee.md) (NUCC). Originally the CMS-1500 claim form was developed under the direction of the Uniform Claim Form Task Force, which was co-chaired by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ([CMS](cms.md)) and the American Medical Association (AMA). The [CMS-1500](cms-1500.md) [Claim Form](claim-form.md) is considered public domain and is not subject to copyright restrictions. The NUCC consists of diverse stakeholders representing the interests of providers, payers, Designated Standards Maintenance Organizations (DSMO), vendors, and public health organizations.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ([HIPAA](hipaa.md)) required the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop, adopt, or modify standards that allow healthcare transactions to be exchanged electronically. Effective January 1, 2012, all [HIPAA](hipaa.md) covered entities are required to send and receive the Accredited Standards Committee ASC X12 Version 5010 for electronic transactions which include:

- Claims (Institutional, Professional and Dental, [COB](coordination-of-benefits.md) (Professional and Institutional), and NCPDP) (837)
- Claims Status Requests and Responses (276/277)
- Remittance (835)
- Enrollment and Disenrollment in a health plan (834)
- Premium Payment (820)
- Eligibility Requests and Responses (270/271)
- Referral Requests and Responses and Prior Authorizations (278)
- Claims Acknowledgements (277CA)
- Acknowledgement for Healthcare Insurance (999)

To assist in this effort, four organizations - the American Dental Association (ADA), National Uniform Billing Committee (NUBC), [NUCC](national-uniform-claim-committee.md), and Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI) - work together on the standards.

Additional areas of responsibilities of NUCC include identifying business needs of the healthcare industry related to the [CMS-1500](cms-1500.md) claim form, advising HHS and CMS on issues related to uniformity of data content and administrative transaction standards, and maintaining the claim form to focus on bringing uniformity to the data content.

The approval process for [CMS-1500](cms-1500.md) claim form revisions includes multiple reviews and approvals. Once the updates are approved by NUCC, the form is submitted to CMS for approval and then awaits public comment through [CMS](cms.md) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before receiving final approval and implementation.

As we discuss the paper forms and each of their fields in this chapter, we will also point out pertinent information for the electronic submissions of the claim form. While the term “item” is used for the field on the paper CMS-1500 claim form, electronic fields refer to the term “loop” for the data elements to be sent. It is important to understand that the Administrative Simplification Compliance Act (ASCA) requires that claims be sent electronically unless unusual circumstances are met.

## EDI
[Electronic Data Interchange](electronic-data-interchange.md) (EDI) for healthcare claims is a computer-to-computer exchange of claims. This method of claims submission replaces postal mail, fax, and email. For more information on the CMS-1500 claim form see https://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/Downloads/837P-CMS-1500.pdf.

```ad-billing
title: Billing
HIPAA allows filing paper claims when it has been determined that due to limitations in the claims transaction formats adopted, it would not be possible to submit the claim electronically. Exceptions allowing for paper claims to be filed to Medicare include:

1. Roster billing of inoculations covered by Medicare.
2. Claims for payment under a Medicare demonstration project that specifies paper submission.
3. “Obligated to Accept as Payment in Full” (OTAF) Medicare Secondary Payer ([[Medicare Secondary Payer Form|MSP]]) claims when there is more than one primary payer
4. MSP claims when there is more than one primary payer and more than one [[allowed amount]]

More information can be found on these exceptions by accessing the CMS Internet-Only Manuals, Publication 100-04 Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 24, 90.3- General EDI and EDI Support Requirements, Electronic Claims and Coordination of Benefits Requirements, Mandatory Electronic Filing of Medicare Claims.

Electronic claims can be submitted from the provider’s computer to a clearinghouse or directly to a payer. To understand the process of electronic submissions, let’s look at claims submitted to a [Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC)](medicare-administrative-contractor-mac.md) (MAC). Once received, the MAC sends the claim through initial edits to determine if the claim has all the requirements necessary to meet the basic HIPAA requirements. If errors are detected at this level, the entire batch of claims is rejected for correction and resubmission. Once claims pass these front-end edits, they are then edited against the HIPAA implementation guide requirements. 

Claims that do not meet these standards are rejected on an individual level and returned electronically to the provider for correction and resubmission. After a claim passes through the first two sets of edits, the claim is then edited for compliance with Medicare coverage and payment policy requirements. The claim is then adjudicated or processed by either being denied or approved for payment.

After claims are successfully transmitted, an acknowledgement report is generated. The acknowledgement report can either be sent back to the provider or placed in an electronic mailbox for the provider to download and process. 

Private payers also process medical claims electronically, utilizing edits that reflect CPT® coding guidelines and conventions, National Correct Coding Initiative ([NCCI](national-correct-coding-initiative.md)) rules, and
[CMS](cms.md) guidelines. They may have additional edits that are specific for their individual coverage plans. 

Paper claims are submitted to Medicare only on a limited basis. Providers who feel they should qualify for a waiver as result of an unusual circumstance must submit their waiver requests to the A/B [MACs](medicare-administrative-contractor-mac.md) or DME [MACs](medicare-administrative-contractor-mac.md) to whom they submit their claims. Private payers also may accept paper claims. It is recommended that medical billers become familiar with private payer guidelines relating to submitting paper claims.

Electronic claims offer important benefits that support the financial well-being of healthcare providers, facilities, and organizations. Submission of electronic claims is inexpensive compared to paper claims and allows improved tracking and faster payments.

All fields of the [CMS-1500](cms-1500.md) and [UB-04](ub-04.md) claim forms must be completed according to payer specifications whether submitted via paper or electronically. The skilled medical biller will become familiar with each payer’s guidelines for claims submission and implement the guidelines correctly to ensure tracking and prompt payment of claims.

All major insurance payers have developed their individual claims submission methods, including online claim submission capabilities as well as traditional billing methods. Medical billers must be aware of their provider’s major payers and become well versed in the policies and procedures. This will be key for correct and [timely](timely-filing.md) claims submission and payment. Some of the major insurance payers include UnitedHealthcare, WellPoint, Kaiser, Humana, Aetna, Cigna, and others. Payers may offer claim submission/real time [Adjudication](adjudication.md) options.

This process allows the medical biller to enter claims data directly into the payer’s database by identifying the provider, patient (member), and then entering the details of the claim. Once this data is entered, a claim summary is generated, and [Adjudication](adjudication.md) status notification is delivered. [Adjudication](adjudication.md) is the term used to describe the process of determining the validity of a claim and the amount the insurer will pay on the claim after the member’s insurance benefits have been applied.

CMS-1500 claim form Version 02/12 was implemented on April 1, 2014 to align with requirements in the Accredited Standards Committee X12 (ASC X12) healthcare claim:
Professional (837P) Version 5010 and 5010A1 (electronic standard required by HIPAA for electronic claims). Each of the fields (items) will be discussed along with any necessary notations regarding electronic submissions for the claim form. Refer to the 02/12 Version of the CMS-1500 claim form (Image 8.A) provided in this chapter to understand each item as it is explained. Although it is important for the medical biller to know and understand the paper and electronic fields, much of the formatting and field completion is programmed into the [Practice Management System](practice-management-system.md) or clearinghouse software. 

Some of the formatting requirements differ from the paper format to the electronic format. For example, the date on a paper field is entered as MMDDCCYY (month, date, century, year) whereas the date in the electronic file is transmitted as CCYYMMDD (century, year, month, date). The format change is done behind the scenes by the practice management software or the clearinghouse software. When a medical biller looks at a claim for accuracy, whether it is transmitted electronically or sent as a paper claim, the claim is often viewed (either printed or electronically on screen) as a completed CMS-1500 claim form. There is typically one person within an office that will understand the full electronic file or that will work with the payer and/or the clearinghouse to troubleshoot behind-the-scene issues. The medical biller must understand completing the claim form with accurate information, but not the technical data elements required for the ASCX12 transmissions.
