# Outpatient Code Editor (OCE)
*Software that edits outpatient hospital [claims](claim-form.md) to detect incorrect billing data and determine if the Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) limit should apply to each claim and reviews each [HCPCS](hcpcs-level-ii.md) and ICD-10-CM code for validity and coverage.*

## [National Correct Coding Initiative](national-correct-coding-initiative.md)
In August of 2000, [NCCI](national-correct-coding-initiative.md) edits were added to the Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) to assist [MACs](medicare-administrative-contractor-mac.md) in processing Part B claims for outpatient hospital services.
