# Allowed amount
*The maximum amount a plan will pay for a covered health care service. May also be called “eligible expense,” “payment allowance,” or “negotiated rate.”*

If your provider charges more than the plan’s allowed amount, you may have to pay the difference. (See [Balance billing](balance-billing.md))
