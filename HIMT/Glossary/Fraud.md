# Fraud
*Making false statements or misrepresenting facts to obtain an undeserved benefit or payment from a federal healthcare program*

## CMS examples of fraud:
- Billing for services and/or supplies that you know were not furnished or provided
- Altering claim forms and/or receipts to receive a higher payment amount
- Billing a [Medicare](medicare.md) patient above the [Allowed amount](allowed-amount.md) for services
- Billing for services at a higher level than provided or necessary
- Misrepresenting the diagnosis to justify payment
- Falsifying documentation

Fraud and [Abuse](abuse.md) carry stiff penalties under 42 USC § 1320a-7a of the United States Code. Civil monetary penalties (CMPs) may be imposed to varying amounts, depending on the type of violation. These penalties range from $10,000 to $50,000 (before inflation adjustment) per violation and can include up to three times the amount claimed for each item or service, or up to three times the amount of remuneration offered, paid, solicited, or received, whether a portion of such remuneration was offered, paid, solicited, or received for a lawful purpose. On top of all that, exclusion from [Participation](participation.md) in the federal healthcare programs and state healthcare programs may be imposed, along with criminal penalties of fines, imprisonment, or both. 

The Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Health & Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG), and the Centers for [Medicare](medicare.md) & [Medicaid](medicaid.md) Services ([CMS](cms.md)) are the government agencies that enforce the federal fraud and [Abuse](abuse.md) laws.
