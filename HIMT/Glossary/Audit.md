# Audit
*A review and evaluation of healthcare procedures and documentation for the purpose of comparing the quality of services or products provided in a given situation.*

An audit is a review and evaluation of healthcare procedures and documentation for comparing the quality of services or products provided in a given situation. Audits may be initiated both internally and externally.

In medical billing, internal audits or monitoring should be in place for each aspect of the billing process. Monitoring compliance with payer contracts, understanding the cause of denials, detecting lost charges, follow up on resubmitted claims, and appeals are areas that require internal auditing.

When areas of concern are detected, processes should be implemented to improve the overall effectiveness of the billing process. Audits may be performed at various stages within the medical billing process. A pre-payment audit occurs before a claim is submitted for payment. A post-payment audit would be performed after a claim has been submitted and either paid or denied. Reviewing paid claims, as well as denied claims, can offer valuable insight into the payer’s behavior and determining whether claims are being paid appropriately, as defined in the payer contract.

External or payer audits are initiated by an entity outside of the provider’s office or facility. For medical billing, the entity will be an insurance payer. When being audited, it is important to have all the documentation available to support the charges. The patient’s medical record, the [CMS-1500](cms-1500.md) claim form, along with the encounter form need to be reviewed. The encounter form will show the diagnosis code(s), procedure(s), supplies, and other services provided during the patient encounter. The [CMS-1500](cms-1500.md) claim form will show if there is an issue between what is entered from the encounter form and what is displayed on the claim form. Discrepancies can arise due to a keying entry error or a [Practice Management System](practice-management-system.md) that has billing rules by payer built into the system.
