# Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS)
The MPFS is the primary method of payment for enrolled health care professionals. Specifically, Medicare uses the MPFS when paying the following services: 
- Professional services of physicians and other enrolled health care professionals in private practice 
- Services covered incident to physicians’ services (other than certain drugs covered as incident to services)
- Diagnostic tests (other than clinical laboratory tests) 
- Radiology services 

Medicare also pays suppliers like Mammography Centers according to the MPFS. Medicare pays Institutional providers like hospitals, Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (CORFs), and Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs) for some services under the MPFS, depending on the institution type and service. For example, Medicare pays hospital outpatient departments for screening mammographies, and outpatient rehabilitation services, under the MPFS. 

The MPFS Look-Up Tool helps health care professionals, suppliers, and institutional providers find Medicare payment amounts for each code so they can calculate the beneficiary coinsurance amount. The MPFS gives the limiting charge for nonparticipating health care professionals and suppliers who treat Medicare beneficiaries. 

The MPFS is an excellent way to learn if HCPCS codes are affected by payment policies like: 
- Payment of assistant at surgery services 
- Applicability of certain [Modifiers](modifiers.md)
- Physician supervision of diagnostic services

## Participating
Participating Health Care Professionals and Suppliers enrolled in Medicare and signed the Form CMS-460, Medicare Participating Physician or Supplier Agreement, agreeing to charge no more than Medicare-approved amounts and deductibles and coinsurance amounts. Participating professionals and suppliers submit assigned claims.

### Assigned claims
Health professionals, suppliers and providers submit Assigned Claims on behalf of the beneficiary. Medicare issues payment to the submitter. 

## Non PAR
Nonparticipating Health Care Professionals and Suppliers enrolled in Medicare but decided not to sign the Form CMS-460. They accept assignment on a case-by-case basis. For services paid under the MPFS, Medicare reduces (5%) the Medicare-approved amounts for nonparticipants. Also, Medicare limits what the health care professional or supplier may charge the beneficiary (Limiting Charge) when they choose not to accept assignment on the claim. 

### Limiting Charge
Limiting Charge equals 115% of the nonparticipating fee schedule amount and is the maximum the nonparticipant may charge a beneficiary on an unassigned claim. The nonparticipating fee schedule amount is equal to 95% of the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. 

### Unassigned Claims
Nonparticipating health care professionals or suppliers not accepting assignment on the claim submit Unassigned Claims. Medicare issues payment to the beneficiary. Use the MPFS Look-Up Tool to learn if payment policies such as payment of assistant at surgery services, applicability of certain modifiers, and physician supervision of diagnostic services affect HCPCS codes.

## Medicare Part B
Medicare Part B pays for physician services based on the Medicare PFS, which lists the more than 7,000 unique codes and their payment rates. Physicians’ services include:
- Office visits
- Surgical procedures
- Anesthesia services
- A range of other diagnostic and therapeutic services 

Physicians provide services in all settings, including:
- Physicians’ offices
- Hospitals
- Ambulatory Surgical Centers
- Skilled Nursing Facilities and other post-acute care settings
- Hospices
- Outpatient dialysis facilities
- Clinical laboratories
- Beneficiaries’ homes

## MPFS Payment Rates
The MPFS payment rates formula shows how a payment rate for an individual service is determined, there’s a description for each component below the formula.

### Relative Value Units (RVUs)
The MPFS uses 3 separate [Relative Value Unit (RVU)](relative-value-unit-rvu.md) to calculate a payment:
1. The Work RVU reflects the relative time and intensity associated with furnishing a Medicare PFS service  and equal approximately 50% of the total payment
2. The Practice Expense (PE) RVU reflects the costs of maintaining a practice (such as renting office space, buying supplies and equipment, and staff costs)
3. The Malpractice (MP) RVU reflects the costs of malpractice insurance

RVUs include the core of physician fees. CMS gives MACs the fee schedule RVUs for all services except the following:
- Those with national codes for which national relative values have not been established
- Those requiring By Report payment or MAC pricing
- Those not included in the definition of physician services

### Geographic Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs) 
Medicare adjusts each of the 3 RVUs to account for geographic variations in the costs of practicing medicine in different areas of the country. Each kind of RVU component has a corresponding GPCI adjustment. 

### Conversion Factor (CF)
To determine the payment rate for a service, CMS systems multiply the sum of the geographically adjusted RVUs by a CF in dollars. The statute specifies the formula by which the CF is updated on an annual basis. 

Typically, CMS updates the CF on an annual basis. Until 2015, CMS used the Medicare Economic Index (MEI) adjusted up or down to calculate the annual update, depending on how actual expenditures compared to a target rate called the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR). 

The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) repealed the Medicare sustainable growth rate (SGR) update formula for payments under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. Effective January 1, 2020, the Physician Fee Schedule update factor is 0.00% and the CF is 36.09. The application of the CF converts RVUs to dollar amounts.

## Quality Payment Program
Effective January 1, 2017, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 repealed the previous formula to update the Medicare PFS and replaced it with several years of increases to overall payments for PFS services. In conjunction with that change, the law created the [ QPP](2-qpp-overview.md), which rewards the delivery of high-quality and cost-efficient beneficiary care. 

You may choose from these tracks:
- Advanced Alternative Payment Models to earn an incentive payment for participation.
- The Merit-based Incentive Payment System to earn a performance-based adjustment to your Medicare payment. It consolidates the components of the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS), Physician Value-based Payment (VBP) Modifier, and Medicare Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program for Eligible Professionals.

## Medicare Fee Schedule
Medicare uses a fee schedule (a complete listing of fees) to pay doctors or other providers and suppliers to pay physicians, other enrolled health care professionals, or providers and suppliers on a Fee-For-Service (FFS) basis. Medicare bases payment on whichever is less, the charge or MPFS amount. In addition to the MPFS, CMS develops fee schedules for ambulance services, clinical laboratory services, and Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS). 

For most codes, Medicare pays 80% of the amount listed and the beneficiary is responsible for 20%. Examples of reductions from the published MPFS amount include:
- Assistants at surgery get 16% of the MPFS rate
- Medicare pays nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and clinical nurse specialists 85%
- Medicare pays registered dietitians or nutrition professionals for medical nutrition therapy services 85%
- Clinical social workers get 75%

## Medicare Administrative Contractors ([MACs](macs.md))
- National Payment Amount: This option searches for information for only the national payment amount. The national payment amount is designated with a MAC locality code of 0000000.
- Specific MAC: Providers use a MAC locality code to search for information indicating a specific geographic area. If you choose this option, select an area from the dropdown menu at the bottom of the page. Some of these areas, such as 01112, have multiple listings. To learn what these numbers represent, reset the search to Specific Locality.
- Specific Locality: This search allows you to drill down to specific cities (for example, 0111205 - San Francisco) if payment varies within a MAC for specific localities. Notice the number for San Francisco starts with the Northern California number followed with a 05.
	- MACs have more than 1 of these locality codes. For example, the JE MAC includes 01182-Southern California; 01112-Northern California; 01212-Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands; and 01312-Nevada.
- All MACs: This option searches for information for the entire nation. The results include the national payment amount, and all MAC localities. This option is helpful for states with multiple payment localities because it groups all localities together for a MAC. Medicare payment may vary within 1 MAC. However, this option doesn’t give locality names. You must know the MAC locality codes, such as those given in the Specific Locality option.
- Site of Service Differential: Under the MPFS, some procedures have a separate Medicare fee schedule for a physician’s professional services when given in a facility (such as a hospital) or a non-facility. Generally, Medicare gives higher payments to physicians and other health care professionals for procedures performed in their offices because they must supply clinical staff, supplies, and equipment. View this differential in the Non-Facility Price and Facility Price columns.

## Pricing
- Non-Facility Price: In Figure 6-1, $123.95 is displayed for 99214 and $173.37 is displayed for 99215. This column includes the fee schedule amount when a physician performs a procedure in a non-facility setting such as the office. (Non-facility fees apply to therapy procedures regardless of whether the physician gives them in facility or non-facility settings.) Occasionally, Medicare pays institutions like hospitals, under the MPFS. When this occurs, Medicare pays them at the non-facility (higher) rate. Although the terminology might seem confusing at first, the higher payment makes sense because here the facility is responsible for the cost of supplying the staff and supplies.
- Facility Price: $96.23 is shown for 99214 and $141.55 for 99215. This is the fee schedule amount when a physician gives this service in a facility setting, such as a hospital or Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC).
- Non-Facility Limiting Charge: $135.42 is shown for 99214 and $189.41 for 99215. This is the maximum amount the providers listed below may charge a beneficiary for the service:
	- Nonparticipating health care professionals
	- Providers who don’t accept assignment
	- Providers who perform the service in an office setting
- Medicare reduces the Medicare-approved amounts for nonparticipating health care professionals and suppliers by 5%. In other words, the amounts in this column add up to 115% of 95% of the amounts in column 5.
- Facility Limiting Charge: $105.13 is shown for 99214 and $154.64 for 99215. This is the maximum amount the providers listed below may charge a beneficiary for the service:
	- Nonparticipating health care professionals
	- Providers who don’t accept assignment
	- Providers who perform the service in a facility setting
- For the technical component of certain diagnostic imaging procedures, Medicare bases payment on the lower of the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) cap or fee schedule amount; however, the MPFS search results don’t reflect payment adjustments. The MPFS Look-Up Tool displays full payments as well as OPPS payments. Also, the MPFS Look-Up Tool can’t display Multiple Procedures Payment Reductions (MPPRs) since too many combinations of HCPCS codes exist.
- BILT SURG – This column displays a 0, which means the 150% payment adjustment for bilateral procedure doesn’t apply. The MPFS bases RVUs on the procedure providers perform as a bilateral procedure. If you report the procedure with modifier 50 or report it twice on the same day (for example, with RT and LT modifiers with a 2 in the units field), Medicare bases payment for both sides on the lower of (a) the total actual charges for both sides or (b) 100% of the fee schedule amount for a single code.
