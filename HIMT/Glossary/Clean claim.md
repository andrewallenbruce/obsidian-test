# Clean claim
*A clean claim contains all required data elements needed to process and pay the claim. A claim with all the elements necessary to adjudicate the claim.*

The Code of Federal Regulations published by the United States government states a clean claim is: 
1. A claim that has no defect, impropriety, lack of any required substantiating documentation or particular circumstance requiring special treatment that prevents [timely](timely-filing.md) payment; and
2. A claim that otherwise conforms to the clean claim requirements for equivalent claims under original [Medicare](medicare.md).

## Claims Generation
After the charges and payments are entered, claims are generated. The [PMS](practice-management-system.md) may send the charges through an editing system or a [Claim scrubber](claim-scrubber.md) to verify all required components of the claim exist in the system. This creates a clean claim.

A clean claim contains all required data elements needed to process and pay the claim. Each insurance carrier will define the elements required for a clean claim. Prompt payment laws and state regulations define how quickly an insurance carrier must respond to a claim. The claim submitted is required to be a clean claim for the regulation to apply.
