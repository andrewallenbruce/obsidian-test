# Medicare
*U.S. government program of hospitalization insurance and voluntary medical insurance for persons aged 65 and older and for certain disabled persons under 65.*

## Background
Medicare was passed into law on July 30, 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson under title XVIII of the Social Security Act. Beneficiaries were able to sign up for the program on July 1, 1966. U.S. citizens were automatically enrolled in Part A Medicare at age 65, which covered hospital stays, and had an option to choose to enroll in Part B Medicare, which covered physician services.

## Overview
Medicare provides health insurance to Americans age 65 and older, and to some younger people with certain disabilities and other health conditions (permanent kidney failure, Lou Gehrig’s disease). Prior to this, people age 65 and older had to either purchase private insurance or pay for healthcare themselves if they weren’t covered under an employer’s plan. Medicare is a social insurance program and covers over 59.1 million people. It is the largest health program in the United States. 

When it was first enacted, Medicare had two parts: Part A for hospital coverage paid for by payroll deductions and Part B for optional medical insurance coverage. No premiums are charged for Part A if a person has contributed through the workforce. Part B, since it is optional, charges a monthly premium to those who wish to participate. The first beneficiaries paid a $40 annual [Deductible](deductible.md) for Part A and paid a monthly premium of $3 for Part B. The biggest change to Medicare came in 2003, when President George W. Bush signed the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) into law on December 8. It added outpatient prescription drug benefits and allowed for coverage of preventive benefits. In 2006, the voluntary Part D outpatient prescription drug benefit became available.

### Medicare now has four parts:
1. Part A: Hospital insurance
2. Part B: Medical insurance for things not covered by hospital insurance (physician’s services, medical supplies, etc.)
3. Part C: Medicare Advantage plans, which are private plans (like [HMOs](health-maintenance-organization.md) and PPOs) run through Medicare that must at least be equivalent to regular Part A and Part B
4. Part D: Prescription drug coverage

As with the other plans discussed earlier, providers agree to participate with Medicare, accept assignment on covered services and be reimbursed under a [Fee schedule](fee-schedule.md). Medicare uses the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule ([MPFS](mpfs.md)) for reimbursement for physician services and other types of services. The [MPFS](medicare-physician-fee-schedule.md) came into use on January 1, 1992. This replaced the old “customary, prevailing, and reasonable” (CPR) payment system. The [MPFS](medicare-physician-fee-schedule.md) is funded by Part B and is comprised of resource costs associated with physician work, practice expense, and professional liability insurance, with each of these three elements assigned a Relative Value Unit (RVU). Each [CPT](current-procedural-terminology.md)® code has [Relative Value Unit (RVU)](relative-value-unit-rvu.md) assigned for each component: physician work (work RVU), practice expense (PE RVU), and professional liability insurance, malpractice (MP RVU). These [Relative Value Unit (RVU)](relative-value-unit-rvu.md) are adjusted based on the Geographical Practice Cost Index (GPCI) associated with various geographic areas for different medical costs and wage differentials. These factors are multiplied by a conversion factor, which is the national dollar amount that is multiplied by the total geographically adjusted RVU to determine the Medicare allowable amount for physician services. For example, the Non-Facility Formula is: (Work RVU x Work GPCI) + (Transitional Non-Facility PE RVU x PE GPCI) + (MP RVU x MP GPCI) x Conversion Factor. Examples of non-facility settings include the physician office or patient home. Medicare pays at 80 percent of the [Fee schedule](fee-schedule.md) once the patient has met the [Deductible](deductible.md).

```ad-Example
title: EXAMPLE Medicare Billing
A patient is seen in the office and 99214 is billed to Medicare Part B for $150.00. 

A Medicare Remittance Advice (RA) is received at the office, listing the [[allowed amount]] as $107.83. 

Medicare paid 80% of the allowed ($107.83) or $86.26 as the patient had met his [[deductible]]. 

The patient’s coinsurance amount is $21.57. 

$42.17 (charged amount $150.00 minus the [[Allowed amount|allowed]] of $107.83) is a contractual [[write-off]] taken by the provider.

If a person does not meet the eligibility requirements to receive Part A at no charge, the Part A premium is $437 for 2019. The Part B premium for 2019 for most Americans is $135.50 per month. Americans with higher Adjusted Gross Incomes (AGIs) may pay a slightly higher premium.

```ad-Example
title: EXAMPLE
In 2019, a patient with Medicare Part A is hospitalized for 70 days. The patient’s [[deductible]] of $1,364 is applicable for the first 60 days. From the 61st day through the 70th day the patient owes a co-insurance amount of $341 per day.
