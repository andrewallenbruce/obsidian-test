# Advanced [Beneficiary](beneficiary.md) Notice (ABN)
*A standardized form that explains to the patient why [Medicare](medicare.md) may deny the particular service or procedure. An ABN protects the provider’s financial interest by creating a paper trail that [CMS](cms.md) requires before a provider can bill the patient for payment if Medicare denies coverage for the stated service or procedure.*
