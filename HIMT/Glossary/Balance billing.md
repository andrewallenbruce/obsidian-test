# Balance billing
*When a provider bills you for the difference between the provider’s charge and the [allowed amount](allowed-amount.md).*

For example, if the provider’s charge is $100 and the [allowed amount](allowed-amount.md) is $70, the provider may bill you for the remaining $30. A preferred provider may not balance bill you for covered services.
